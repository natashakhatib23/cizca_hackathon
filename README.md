Imagine a world where noise pollution is meticulously monitored and managed, leading to quieter, healthier, and more harmonious urban
environments. Cisza, an innovative project designed for a programming hackathon in Warsaw, aims to achieve this by
harnessing the power of technology and the community. By utilizing a vast network of smartphone sound sensors integrated into a
blockchain ecosystem, Cisza aspires to tackle the global issue of noise pollution.




# How It Works

1. Distributed Network of Sensors: Smartphones with sound sensors act as noise monitors. These devices are strategically distributed across urban and rural areas, ensuring widespread coverage.
2. Blockchain Integration: The noise data collected by thesesmartphones is securely transmitted and stored on a blockchain
network. This ensures data integrity, transparency, and decentralization.
3. Tokenized Incentives: Community members who participate in the Cisza network are rewarded with tokens. These tokens can be used
within the ecosystem or exchanged, incentivizing continuous and accurate data collection.

# Why Warsaw?
Warsaw, with its vibrant tech scene and commitment to environmental sustainability, is the perfect launchpad for Cisza. The
cityâ€™s diverse urban landscape provides an ideal environment for testing and refining the system, paving the way for global implementation.

## Instructions to run

Clone the project,

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/natashakhatib23/cizca_hackathon.git
```

Install the dependencies,

```sh
$ cd cizca_hackathon
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start a blockchain node server,

```sh
$ export FLASK_APP=node_server.py
$ flask run --port 8000
```

### For windows users
```
set LANG=C.UTF-8
set FLASK_APP=node_server.py
flask run --port 8000
```
One instance of our blockchain node is now up and running at port 8000.


Run the application on a different terminal session,

```sh
$ python run_app.py
```

### For windows users
```
set LANG=C.UTF-8
set FLASK_APP=run_app.py
flask run --port 8000
```

The application should be up and running at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).


To play around by spinning off multiple custom nodes, use the `register_with/` endpoint to register a new node. 

Here's a sample scenario that you might wanna try,

```sh
# Make sure you set the FLASK_APP environment variable to node_server.py before running these nodes
# already running
$ flask run --port 8000 &
# spinning up new nodes
$ flask run --port 8001 &
$ flask run --port 8002 &
```

Here are a few screenshots

3. Resyncing with the chain for updated data
